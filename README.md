## Features

- **`/report`** — full server health report (disk, memory, load, services, SSL cert expiry, contact form health, pending updates)
- **`/status`** — quick service status snapshot
- **`/upgrade`** — run `apt upgrade` now (confirmation required)
- **`/reboot`** — reboot with a two-step confirmation and 60-second expiry
- **`/logs <service> [lines]`** — tail recent journal logs for a monitored service (default: 20 lines, max 50)
- **`/help`** — command list
- **Proactive alerts** — background monitoring fires a Telegram message when a service goes down or disk usage exceeds your threshold, and a follow-up when it recovers

The daily report runs automatically on a systemd timer (default: every day at 7AM UTC). A weekly full system upgrade also runs automatically (default: Sundays at 3AM UTC).

## Requirements

- Linux server with `systemd`
- Python 3 (stdlib only — no pip installs needed)
- `curl`, `openssl` on the server
- `fail2ban` (optional — security stats in reports will show `n/a` without it)
- A Telegram bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dustinkznet/vps-bot.git
cd vps-bot
```

### 2. Create the env file

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/bots
sudo cp server.env.example /etc/bots/server.env
sudo nano /etc/bots/server.env
```

Fill in your Telegram bot token, chat ID, and the lists you want monitored:

- `MONITORED_DOMAINS` — checked for SSL cert expiry and `/api/health` endpoint status
- `MONITORED_SERVICES` — systemd service names checked in `/status`, daily reports, and proactive alerts
- `DISK_WARN_PCT` — disk usage percentage that triggers a proactive alert (default: 80)
- `CERT_WARN_DAYS` — days before SSL expiry to show a warning in reports (default: 14)
- `ALERT_INTERVAL_MINUTES` — how often the bot checks services and disk in the background (default: 5)

### 3. First-time server setup

Create the runtime user, install dir, and state dir:

```bash
sudo useradd --system --no-create-home --shell /usr/sbin/nologin serverbot
sudo mkdir -p /opt/bots/server /var/lib/serverbot
sudo chown -R serverbot:serverbot /opt/bots/server /var/lib/serverbot
```

### 4. Deploy

From your local machine:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

This copies the bot scripts, the systemd unit files (in `systemd/`), and the sudoers file (in `sudoers/`) into place, validates the sudoers file before installing it, reloads systemd, enables the daily-report and weekly-upgrade timers, and restarts the bot. By default it deploys to host `webserver1` — override with `VPS_BOT_HOST=otherhost ./deploy.sh`.

The deploy script is the only supported way to push changes — running individual `scp`s by hand is how config and code drift apart.

## Contact form health checks

The daily report checks `https://<domain>/api/health` for each domain in `MONITORED_DOMAINS`. This endpoint should return HTTP 200 when healthy. If a domain doesn't have this endpoint it will show `❌ (HTTP 404)` in the report — that's expected and not a problem. To skip the check for a domain, simply leave it out of `MONITORED_DOMAINS` and monitor it separately.

## Schedules

Two systemd timers run automatically:

- **`server-daily-report.timer`** — daily at 7AM UTC. Runs `daily-report.sh` and posts the health summary to Telegram.
- **`server-weekly-upgrade.timer`** — Sundays at 3AM UTC. Runs `weekly-upgrade.sh` (full `apt upgrade`).

To change a schedule, edit the `OnCalendar=` line in the corresponding timer file under `systemd/`, then `./deploy.sh`. See [systemd OnCalendar syntax](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.time.html) for format examples.

## Security notes

- The bot only responds to the `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` set in `server.env` — all other senders are silently ignored
- Tokens and credentials live in `/etc/bots/server.env`, which is root-owned and never committed to git
- Reboot and upgrade both require two-step confirmation with a 60-second expiry
- Proactive alert state is held in memory — if the bot restarts while a service is down, it will re-alert once on startup

## Updating

Edit files locally, then:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

That's it. The deploy script handles file ownership, permissions, sudoers validation, and the systemd reload/restart.
